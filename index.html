              <h3>Fire and fury like the world has never seen</h3>
              <p>
                In a statement following North Korea's threat to fire missiles at Guam, Trump, on August 8, stated that should North Korea make any more threats to the United States, "They will be met with fire and firy like the world has never seen." It however remains to be seen if either North Korea or Trump will make good their threats. Tensions between the two countries have not been higher since the Korean war in 1950.

              <h3>Fire and fury like the world has never seen</h3>
              <p>
                In a statement following North Korea's threat to fire missiles at Guam, Trump, on August 8, stated that should North Korea make any more threats to the United States, "They will be met with fire and firy like the world has never seen." It however remains to be seen if either North Korea or Trump will make good their threats. Tensions between the two countries have not been higher since the Korean war in 1950.

          <h3>Plastic bags soon to be gone</h3>
          <p>After previous failed attempts, the Kenyan government finally passed a ban on all plastic bags used for commercial and household packaging. The ban which will come into effect on August 28 is expected to end the menace of plastic litter in the country. <abbr title="National Environment Management Authority">NEMA</abbr> has stated that no businesses will be exempt from the ban except for duty free shops which are considered to be outsside the Kenyan territoty. In addition, travellers entering the country will be expected to leave them at entry points.
